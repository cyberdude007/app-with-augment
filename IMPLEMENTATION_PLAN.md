- Test adaptive layouts

### Step 18: Golden Tests
- Create golden tests for analytics screens
- Test theme variations
- Test responsive layouts

### Step 19: Integration Tests
- Test complete expense creation flow
- Test backup/restore round-trip
- Test settlement flow
- Test app lock functionality

### Step 20: Performance & Polish
- Optimize database queries
- Add loading states
- Improve error handling
- Add accessibility features

## Database Migration Strategy

### Current Schema Status
- Schema is already well-designed and matches spec
- No breaking changes required
- Current version: 1

### Migration Steps
1. Add default categories during app initialization
2. Ensure proper foreign key constraints
3. Add indexes for performance-critical queries
4. No data migration needed (fresh install)

### Data Preservation
- Current implementation preserves all relationships
- Soft delete patterns for archived groups
- Audit trail with createdAt/updatedAt timestamps

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Priority
1. **Critical Algorithms**: Split calculations, settlement optimization
2. **Money Operations**: Formatting, conversion, rounding
3. **Business Logic**: Category management, expense validation
4. **Utilities**: Date formatting, search algorithms

### Widget Testing Priority
1. **Core Flows**: New expense creation, category selection
2. **Interactive Components**: Toggle switches, form inputs
3. **Responsive Behavior**: Adaptive layouts, breakpoint handling
4. **State Management**: Provider interactions, form state

### Golden Testing Priority
1. **Analytics Screens**: Charts and statistics display
2. **Theme Variations**: Light/dark mode consistency
3. **Responsive Layouts**: Phone/tablet/foldable layouts

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Split Algorithms**: Extensive unit testing with edge cases
2. **Responsive Design**: Test on multiple screen sizes
3. **Performance**: Profile analytics queries, add pagination

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Algorithm Testing**: Property-based testing for split calculations
2. **Layout Testing**: Device lab testing or emulator matrix
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add performance metrics and monitoring
