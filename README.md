### Database Schema
The app uses a normalized SQLite database with the following main entities:
- **Members**: Individual users/contacts
- **Groups**: Expense sharing groups
- **Expenses**: Individual expense records
- **SplitShares**: How expenses are split among members
- **Settlements**: Payment records between members
- **Reminders**: Scheduled notifications
- **AppSettings**: App configuration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (>=3.13.0)
- Dart SDK (>=3.1.0)
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Android device/emulator or iOS device/simulator

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd paisa_split
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Generate code**
   ```bash
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build
   ```

4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Code Generation

This project uses code generation for:
- **Drift**: Database code generation
- **Riverpod**: Provider code generation

Run code generation when you modify:
- Database tables or DAOs
- Riverpod providers with annotations

```bash
# One-time generation
flutter packages pub run build_runner build

# Watch for changes (development)
flutter packages pub run build_runner watch
```

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. **Create feature module** in `lib/features/`
2. **Add database entities** if needed in `lib/data/db/drift/`
3. **Create repositories** in `lib/data/repos/`
4. **Add providers** for state management
5. **Create UI screens** and widgets
6. **Add navigation routes** in `lib/app/router.dart`

### Database Migrations

When modifying database schema:
1. Update table definitions in `lib/data/db/drift/tables.dart`
2. Increment `schemaVersion` in `AppDatabase`
3. Add migration logic in `onUpgrade` method
4. Run code generation: `flutter packages pub run build_runner build`

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run integration tests
flutter drive --target=test_driver/app.dart
```

### Building for Release

```bash
# Android
flutter build apk --release
flutter build appbundle --release

# iOS
flutter build ios --release
```

## Key Components

### Money Handling
The app uses a custom `Money` class for precise currency calculations:
- Stores amounts in smallest currency unit (paise for INR)
- Provides formatting and arithmetic operations
- Prevents floating-point precision issues

### Offline-First Architecture
- All data stored locally in SQLite database
- No network dependencies for core functionality
- Optional backup/restore for data portability
- Optimistic UI updates with local state management

### Security Features
- PIN and biometric authentication
- Secure storage for sensitive data
- Data encryption for backups
- Auto-lock functionality

### Settlement Algorithm
Smart debt settlement optimization:
- Minimizes number of transactions
- Handles complex multi-party settlements
- Supports partial payments
- Maintains transaction history
